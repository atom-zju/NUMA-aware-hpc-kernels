Both the original lock managers and our scalable lock managers are in
the same source tree.  Unfortunately, this makes the code a tangled
ifdef mess, but it has the advantage that you have a lot of control
over which features you build.

The source tree also includes a backport and extension of the advanced
lock statistics patch from
  http://osdir.com/ml/pgsql-hackers/2009-09/msg00801.html

The core of the scalable heavyweight lock manager is implemented out
of tree, in the gsl directory.  This code is designed to work both in
Postgres and in the testing framework under gsl.  These are very
different environments, so the gsl code depends on numerous stubs.
For example, Postgres runs each thread in a separate address space so
shared state must be explicit, while the tester runs in one address
space so non-shared data must be explicit, so the gsl code makes both
explicit and depends on the environment to do the right thing.
